        title: 'ONE-PAN CHEESY CHICKEN, BROCCOLI, AND RICE',
        ingredients: `3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 medium yellow onion, , diced finely
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, , cut into bite sized pieces
2 cloves of garlic, , minced
1 teaspoon of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1 cup uncooked extra long grain white rice
2 1/2 cups of low-sodium chicken broth, (I like to use Better than Buillion Chicken base)
2 1/2 cups broccoli florets, , cut into bite sized pieces
2 cups shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese`,
        directions: `In a large skillet or pan, sauté onions in two tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper.
Once onions soften, increase the heat to medium high and add chicken to the pan.
Brown the chicken pieces and add the garlic. Cook for about 1 more minute.
Push chicken to one side of the pan and add additional tablespoon of olive oil to other side.
Add the uncooked rice in the olive oil and saute it for a couple of minutes.
Add the chicken broth to the pan and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cover the pan with a lid.
Cook chicken and rice mixture covered for about 12 minutes.
Sprinkle the broccoli evenly over the chicken and rice mixture and stir to combine.
Continue to cook covered another 8 minutes on low, or until broccoli and rice are both tender.
Remove from heat and stir in half a cup of cheese.
Sprinkle remaining cheese on top and cover with a lid, letting it sit for 1-2 minutes or until cheese has melted.
NOTES
If you're using rotisserie chicken add the chicken at the end with the cheese just to heat it through.

You need a large skillet or pan with a higher edge for this dish to hold everything. I used a 12-inch skillet that had a slightly raised edge and it worked great.`,
